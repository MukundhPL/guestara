## Setup

- Run "npm i" to install required node_modules 
- Make sure you have a PostgreSQL instance and pass the required credentials in .env file
- Run "npm run start" to  start the server
- Server will run in by default [http://localhost:3500](http://localhost:3500), can be changed by setting the PORT in the .env file
- Note: You might find it easier to do DML operations using drizzle-kit studio with its nice UI interface. To use it run "npm run studio" and go to [https://local.drizzle.studio](https://local.drizzle.studio)

## Useful commands
- ### npm run db:gen
    - Generates DDL commands based on schema in schema.js
- ### npm run db:mig
    - Migrates DDL commands generated by db:gen based on schema in schema.js
- ### npm run studio
    - Launches Drizzle Studio - a useful tool to visualize data in database and perform DML commands
- ### npm i 
    - Installs node modules
- ### npm run start
    - Migrates DB changes and starts server 

## Questions
- ### Which database you have chosen and why?
    - I have use Postgres using Drizzle ORM as I have experience with Postgres from my last internship and also because its quick and reliable. Drizzle ORM also makes writing it very simple.
- ### 3 things that you learned from this assignment?
    - Setting up a basic CRUD API
    - Database design to accomodate the given problem
    - Debugging and testing code
- ### What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
    - The most difficult part of the assignment for me was debugging and testing the code since I could code up the basic skeleton of the code due to my prior experience but finding small errors or abnormalities in the code was time-consuming 
- ### What would you have done differently given more time?
    - I would have made a simple item selection and billing feature expanding upon the taxes and item costs mentioned in the schema
